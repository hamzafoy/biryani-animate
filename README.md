## What is this?

While designing a website for a Pakistani client who runs a catering service, I found myself becoming more interested in incredible `SVG` animations. I initially designed this with HTML5, CSS3, but decided to publish a neat little `React` component for anyone's use. If you deem it useful to you, thanks for the download - **Bohot Shukriya!**

## Installation

1. Run `npm install biryani-animate`
2. Import using `import { AnimatedCookingPot } from 'biryani-animate'`
3. Enjoy a *starting state* of animated flames underneath the pot & a `:hover` animation of steam rising from the pot as the lid is raised.

## Notes

* Biryani & Halwa, go to any Pakistani establishment and ask for these two, thank me later. 
* The color scheme is intended to imitate the clay pots that one might find the first dish cooked in.
